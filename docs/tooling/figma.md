# Governance - Figma Workflow

Figma-specific rules for authoring and reviewing variables.

For the full Tokens Studio operating model, see:

- [Tokens Studio](../tokens-studio)

## Figma rules

1. Designers should apply semantic alias tokens for UI intent.
2. Avoid duplicating raw values in components when a token exists.
3. Token changes land through the repo JSON (export -> PR -> review).
4. Keep modes limited (example: `light`, `dark`).
5. Token names must follow the naming convention.

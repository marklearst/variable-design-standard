# Variable Design Standard (VDS) Change Log

Version history and release notes for Variable Design Standard (VDS).

## Version 0.5.0 (Current)

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** January 27, 2026

Spec-wide cadence alignment, role naming update, and JSON-as-API framing.

### Changes

- Added “Scope + Failure if ignored” openers across scenarios, patterns, consumption, testing, adoption, and design docs.
- Tightened introduction pages to a spec voice and removed guide-only phrasing.
- Aligned navigation labels with page titles (UI Libraries).

#### JSON-as-API framing

- Declared JSON-as-API as the interface across contract, governance, patterns, consumption, and reference glossary.
- Reinforced file selection rule as the brand/mode switch instead of mapped layers.

#### Role naming and governance clarity

- Renamed Frontend Developer to Frontend Engineer across governance, tooling, adoption, and reference docs.
- Added or refined workflow and review checklists to reinforce governance gates.
